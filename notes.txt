1) Install Next.js and create the client and server folders 

We're going to use the Next.js framework with TypeScript. 
The team-builder repository will contain two folders: client 
and server.

2) Remove the styles folder and all style references

We don't need the style files because we're going to use Chakra UI 
for styling, so the styles folder and all references to it can be
deleted.

3) Create app in Google Cloud Console and store the environment variables 
from it in an .env file

For development, under Credentials, set Authorized JavaScript origins to http://localhost:3000
and Authorized redirect URIs to http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google.

TODO: Change these two URIs after deployment.

Create the env file in the client folder and store the client ID and 
client secret from Google Cloud Console in it.
