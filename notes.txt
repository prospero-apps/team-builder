Team Builder is a web applications that you can use to communicate with
other people (both individual and group conversations). The goal of the 
app is to enable people interested in sports to get in touch with other
people also interested in the same discipline and based in the same location
so that they can build teams.

Technologies used:

Next.js
Prisma

1) Install Next.js and create the client and server folders 

We're going to use the Next.js framework with TypeScript. 
The team-builder repository will contain two folders: client 
and server.

2) Remove the styles folder and all style references

We don't need the style files because we're going to use Chakra UI 
for styling, so the styles folder and all references to it can be
deleted.

3) Create app in Google Cloud Console and store the environment variables 
from it in an .env file

For development, under Credentials, set Authorized JavaScript origins to http://localhost:3000
and Authorized redirect URIs to http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google.

TODO: Change these two URIs after deployment.

Create the env file in the client folder and store the client ID and 
client secret from Google Cloud Console in it.

4) Install Prisma and configure NextAuth.js to use the Prisma adapter

Prisma will be used to communicate with the database. In order to configure
NextAuth.js to use the Prisma adapter, we'll add: 
- the lib/prismadb.ts file with our Prisma Client,
- the auth/[...nextauth].ts file in pages/api in the client.

We'll add the configuration code from the documentation.
